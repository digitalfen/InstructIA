# Key Features

InstructIA offers a range of powerful features designed to enhance your development workflow with AI-driven automation based on **Prompt-Oriented Development (POD)**.

## Context Management

At its core, InstructIA provides a robust system for managing contextual information crucial for AI interactions. This involves:

- **Structured Organization**: Context data, such as prompts, configurations, and relevant documents, are stored in a well-defined directory structure. This context primarily consists of natural language elements, aligning with the **POD** focus on prompt-based information.
- **AI Consumption**: Information is formatted and organized in a way that is easily consumable by AI models, ensuring consistency and accuracy in responses or actions.
- **Access & Manipulation**: Default instructions like `instructia context_create-backup`, `instructia context_load-backup`, and `instructia context_update` allow for easy management and versioning of the context using simple commands.

This structured, prompt-centric approach simplifies the process of feeding relevant information to AI, making interactions more effective.

## Keyword Instructions

Keyword Instructions are a core concept in InstructIA, acting as **contextual data points** that serve as triggers for predefined action sequences. This directly embodies the **POD** principle of using natural language triggers for structured, modular execution.

- **Trigger System**: When you run `instructia <keyword>`, the system identifies the corresponding instruction data within the current context.
- **Defined Action Sequences**: Each instruction keyword is linked to a specific list of actions (defined via natural language prompts). This ensures that invoking a keyword executes a consistent, modular workflow.
- **Automation via Prompts**: Streamline repetitive development tasks, AI interactions, or project-specific workflows by defining these trigger-action mappings entirely through natural language instructions stored in the context.

This feature turns complex operations into simple, memorable commands, where the logic resides in structured, prompt-based data rather than direct code.

## Extensibility

The InstructIA framework is designed to be highly extensible, allowing you to tailor it to your specific project needsâ€”all through natural language, a cornerstone of **POD**.

- **Custom Instructions**: Easily create your own keyword instructions (trigger data points) using `instructia instruction_create`.
- **Custom Actions**: Define the *tasks* or *goals* (the sequence of actions) for your custom instructions using natural language prompts. The framework interprets these prompts to execute the desired workflow.
- **Modular Design**: The framework follows **POD** principles, encouraging modularity, making it easier to add, modify, or share instructions (triggers) and their associated actions (prompt sequences).

This flexibility ensures that InstructIA can grow and adapt alongside your project requirements, focusing on defining *what* needs to be done rather than *how* in code.

## Internationalization

InstructIA supports multiple languages to cater to a global user base.

- **Multi-Language Support**: Currently supports English (en-US) and Portuguese (pt-BR). Support for more languages is planned for future versions.
- **Language Selection**: Choose your preferred language during installation (`npm install instructia --language=pt-BR`) or configure it later.
- **User Experience**: Provides interface text, messages, and potentially prompt elements in the selected language, improving accessibility and usability for non-English speakers.

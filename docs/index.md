# Instructa Framework

A powerful framework based on POD (Prompt-Oriented Development) for automating AI-driven instructions and actions.

## Overview

Instructa is a framework that enables the creation of structured, modular, and reusable prompts for AI systems. It provides a standardized environment for managing context, executing predefined actions, and extending functionality through a keyword-based command system.

The framework is particularly useful for IDEs with integrated AI capabilities (like Cursor and WindSurf), where it helps generate and manage context for AI consumption.

## Key Features

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g instructa

# Initialize a new project
